Hello!

I learned that git is a version control application useful for organization and development of applications in group settings.
I learned it was originally a command line interface and now GitHub is the GUI version that is cloud based.
I learned about repositories and how branches/pull requests are used.

I have questions about the security of GitHub. I had the preconception that Github was all opensource so I am wondering how one would make private repositories
